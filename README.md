# Rust 101
Learning rust from the very beginning

- Following rust docs book
-- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

# List of things learned
-> Cargo (buid, run, check): Build tool and package/dependency manager
	Toml file (Tom's Obvious mini language): Configuration file. also called a manifest

-> Rust has an in-built library called Prelude (std::prelude) : https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html
	If a type or function isn't on the std::prelude we can import it by typing the 'use' statement
	We can search for crates on : https://crates.io

-> Rust is an imperative programming language but it has imports aspects from the fucntional world
	By default rust variables are immutable, they can't be manipulated. let a = 1 sets the variable 'a' to '1' and you can't manipulate that variable
	let mut a = 1, gives you the possibility the modify the variable a by declaring it as mutable

-> The '::' represents the association between the crate and its functions
	String::new() -> represents the function new() from String. It returns an instance of String

-> Rust handles data very safely!
	Calling io::stdin()::readline().except() handles the 'ok' value returned 
	io::stdin()::readline().except() handles the 'err' value returned

-> Result is an enumeration 
	Each state in Result is called a variant

-> To add dependencies (libs, crates, ..) we need to modify the toml file
	Cargo.lock file ensures that your project is reproducible and tracks version of all the dependencies it uses

-> Rust allows us to shadow variables
	Shadowing is when we declare a variable with name 'x' and then we reasign the name 'x' to another value
	In this example the first 'x' got shadowed by the second

-> Matching allows us to deconstruct an expression and match it against possible values it may evaluate to
	The 'match' expression is composed by an expression we are matching against (e.g. match {expr} { arms.. })
	Arms are the possible matches the expression can evaluate to
	
-> Prefixing a variable with an underscore prevents the compiler of warning us against an unused variable

-> Enumerations like Result can be matched to handle errors
	eg: match {Â ok() => , Err(_) => ,}
	We can either let .except() handle the error, or match the result against a possible Ok() or Err()

-> We cannot add two diferent types od data
	e.g. integer + floating-point numbers
	Rust has scalar and compound data types
	scalar: Represent a single value:  integers, floating-point numbers, booleans and characters
	Char type is 4 bytes long and represents an unicode Scalar data type
	compound: Represent data types that can hold multiple values: tuples and arrays

-> Any expression that doesn't hold any value or return any value is called an unit ' () '

-> Arrays are another compund data type available in rust
	They are fixed size and every element needs to hava the same type
	Syntax : arr = [1, 2, 3] || arr : [type; size] = [1, 2, ...] || arr = [1; size]

-> Both tuples and arrays are stack allocated !

-> Rust is is an expression based language where there's a distinction between statements and expressions
	Statements don't evaluate to a value; e.g. let a = 5;
	Expression do evaluate (return) to a value; e.g. let a = 5 + 5;
	
-> We can return what a 'loop' evaluates to using break keyword
	e.g. let l = loop { break 5 };
	break can either return a value, or unit '()' if used alone e.g. break;

-> Ownership is a set of rules that dictate how memory is handled in Rust
	Each value in Rust has an owner
	A value can only have one owner at a time
	When the value goes out of scope, it is dropped (freed)
	Let's say we declare a var in main, once that variable is passed onto a function we cannot use it after that
	e.g. fn main {let s = String::new(); another_function(s);}

-> Structs are used to group data that coorelate to each other
	There are named tuples aswell, e.g: Color (i16, i16, i16);
	In order to print structs the #[derive(Debug)] attribute is necessary
